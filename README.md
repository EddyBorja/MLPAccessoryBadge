MLPAccessoryBadge
=================

>"When you have a big table of cells, it helps to have navigation cues that can give you some idea about what you should expect if you were to select a _UITableViewCell_. A lot of apps use these little badges in a cell's accessory view that contain numbers or text to provide these kind of hints, but there's no simple way to make these... until now. Presenting _MLPAccessoryBadge_!"

About
---------
_MLPAccessoryBadge_ is a delightfully customizable UIView subclass that renders text inside a badge, created mainly for use in a _UITableViewCell_ as its `accessoryView` property. Use it to hint at quantities, states, notifications, urgency, etc...

An _MLPAccessoryBadge_ is not restricted solely for use in a _UITableViewCell_, it was just designed with that use case in mind. Feel free to find other creative uses for the accessory badge!

_MLPAccessoryBadge_ requires no graphic files to work, all drawing happens natively. This means you can customize colors, shading and shapes with ease!


Usage
---------

1. Add the _MLPAccessoryBadge.h_ and _MLPAccessoryBadge.m_ files to your project.

2. Make sure you have Apple's QuartzCore framework added to your project, _MLPAccessoryBadge_ needs it for drawing routines.

3. Now it's time to create your badge. Assuming `cell` is a _UITableViewCell_ for your _UITableView_, the following code creates a simple gray badge as the accessory view of your cell:

`MLPAccessoryBadge *accessoryBadge = [MLPAccessoryBadge new];`

`[accessoryBadge setText:@"Hello World"];`

`[cell setAccessoryView:accessoryBadge];`

Check the header file of _MLPAccessoryBadge_ to find more customization options.
